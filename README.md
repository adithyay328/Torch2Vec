# Torch2Vec(Skipgram Word2Vec)
In this repo is a basic implementation of a
Skipgram Configured Word2Vec model. For the sake
of simplicitly, this code does not perform negative
sampling or limits the number of weight updates. This
may be added at a later date, but as of today this is
not supported functionality. 

Ease of understanding is
the main metric we're optimizing for.
